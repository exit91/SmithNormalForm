SmithNormalForm

Implementing an algorithm to calculate the Smith normal form


This is an bottom up approach using no other libraries other than the standard libraries,
for practice.

The challenge is to write the algorithm in a functional language from an inherently
imperative specification (which uses 'goto'!). On the way I noticed that Lenses come
in pretty handily for 'focusing' and mutating on parts of the structure in an elegant
manner.
